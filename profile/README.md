# The Four Corners Science and Computing Club (4CSCC)

The Four Corners Science and Computing Club (4CSCC) is an education and outreach program led by teams at Northern Arizona University and Fort Lewis College. The short-term goal of 4CSCC is to build awareness of and interest in careers in scientific computing, with a focus on schools primarily serving Native American students. The long-term goal is to increase representation and inclusion of Native Americans in open source scientific computing.
